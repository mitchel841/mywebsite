Sometimes when I see the word "Premium" I automatically think, this is just some Huckleberry Finn marketing strategy using one of the oldest tricks in the book: making something sound better than it really is. Sometimes I think, "Wow, this is gonna be another gimmick!" But is this the case with this Premium Jasmine Green Tea? Read on to find out.

When I first got my premium jasmine dragon pearl green tea sample, the first thing you notice is the shape of the tea. The tea leaves have been balled up into a pearl shape the size of a small marble. The point of doing this is to keep the leaves dry during storage, slowly open up the leaves during the brewing process, and to offer a deeper level of flavor and floral aroma, which works well to release jasmine's beautiful fragrance.

After my first brew, the dragon pearls have yet to open all the way, with the leaves barely blossoming. This brew was nice and light, filled with the jasmine's aroma and taste. On the second brew, the pearls began to open, with the leaves uncurling, straightening themselves out. Now, you get more of the green tea flavor, with the jasmine notes acting in a supporting role. In the 3rd and 4th brew, the leaves open up, giving you much more of the green tea flavor you'd expect from a premium green tea.

You can see the uniformity in the leaves, without any cuts or pieces looking like stems or twigs. A beautiful sign of quality tea.

## My Brew Method

A great cup of tee begins with good water. A good rule of thumb is, if you wouldn't drink that water normally, don't use it to brew your tea. The taste of clean filtered water helps bring out the delicate flavors in this tea. My favorite way of brewing this tea is to boil water to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and pour 350ml of water into 7 grams of our Premium Jasmine Dragon Pearls and steep for 30 seconds. Each time you make a new cup, the leaves will open more and more, with the first and second cup being my favorite :)

## Region

This Jasmine Dragon Pearl Green Tea is grown and produced in the Mt. Taimu area of Fujian province.  The jasmine used in this tea is grown on a 200 acre plantation in Guangxi province.
This tropical mountainous coastal area is perfect for growing teas. The area has an abundant rainfall, with many misty days in spring, and temperatures that are neither too hot in summer nor too cold in winter. The mountains around the farms are more than 80% forested, ensuring the soil has a high natural fertility and organic content, removing the need to use fertilizers.

My Verdict: I give this Jasmine Dragon Pearl Green Tea 10/10.
